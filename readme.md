# RealityFrame

RealityFrame is a real-time computer vision project built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It combines gesture recognition, background reconstruction, selective invisibility, and AR effects to create an interactive privacy and visual effects system.

## Features

* Gesture-controlled invisibility modes
* Partial invisibility using pinch/snap gesture
* Full invisibility using L-hand gesture
* Custom focus area selection
* Real-time background reconstruction
* AR overlay support
* Smooth blending and masking effects

## Practical Uses

### Online Meetings

Keep only your workspace visible while hiding distractions around you. This can prevent people walking behind you from appearing on camera and helps maintain privacy during calls.

### Content Creation

Create unique visual effects and selective visibility regions without requiring a green screen.

### Privacy Enhancement

Hide unwanted areas of a room while keeping important objects or workspaces visible.

## Controls

| Action                | Control              |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Partial Invisibility  | Pinch / Snap Gesture |
| Full Invisibility     | L-Hand Gesture       |
| Start Focus Selection | F                    |
| Select Visible Region | 4 Mouse Clicks       |
| Reset Selection       | R                    |
| Quit Application      | Q                    |
